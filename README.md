# Robots

There are a number of robots who need to press some buttons in a correct order.

## Rules

* Robots start at position 1
* It takes 1 second for a robot to move 1 position
* It takes 1 second for a robot to press a button
* One robot can press 1 button at a time
* While a robot pressed the button, the others can move in the mean time

## Requirements & Running

The main function is `time_robots(sequence, robots)`

You need `pytest` to run the unit tests (see `requirements.pip`). 

You'll understand how it works by looking at the tests.
